# Taskly-React-TypeScript-To-Do-App

A clean, interactive To‑Do List application built with React, TypeScript, and browser local storage, to showcase strong typing, component-based UI structure, and state management.

## 🧠 Overview
Taskly allows users to add, edit, mark complete, and delete tasks — all within a responsive UI. Tasks persist between page loads using local storage, and all logic is fully typed in TypeScript.

## ✨ Features
💡 **Add new tasks:** Enter task text and submit to create a new to‑do.

✅ **Toggle complete:** Click a task to mark it done or undone.

✏️ **Edit tasks:** Update task text inline.

🗑️ **Delete tasks:** Remove tasks with a click.

🔁 **Persistence:** Tasks saved to local storage, so state is maintained across sessions.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
🔹 **React** (functional components, hooks)

🔹 **TypeScript** (strong typing of props, state, and task models)

🔹 **Create React App** (bootstrapped TS project)

🔹 **CSS or Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
